**Q:** Should I use Pawn? What's a good Pawn string for X spec?

**Q:** How do I sim my character?
**A:** Raidbots - <https://www.raidbots.com>

**Q:** What's the best race for X spec?

**Q:** What's the best spec for leveling?
**A:** You can level with similar efficiency using any spec. It *really* doesn't matter. Play what you think is the most fun.
