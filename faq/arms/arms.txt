**__FAQ__**

**Q:** What is the best Covenant?
**A:** At this moment, <:condemn:742631092279967785> **Venthyr** is the best covenant for raiding. However <:Aftershock:742631092326236282> **Night Fae** is very competitive on single target and is much better for AoE/M+. <:Spear:742631092711981106> **Kyrian** is a bit weaker than Night Fae but still viable for Raid/M+. <:whyisthisgood:742631092229767220> **Necrolord** is in theory the strongest option for overall group damage however not every group can get the best value out of it. 

**Q:** What are the best Potency Conduits?
**A:** Single Target: Ashen Juggernaut (Venthyr) > Mortal Combo > Crash the Ramparts ~= Veteran's Repute (Necrolord) > Ashen Juggernaut (Non-Venthyr) > Covenant Conduits
       Aoe/M+: Crash the Ramparts > Covenant Conduits > Mortal Combo > Rest

**Q:** What are the best Soulbindings?
**A:** Venthyr: Nadjia > Theotar > Draven
       Night Fae: Niya > Korayn > Dreamweaver (Niya is best on single target, however Korayn's "First Strike" for AoE is much better than Niya)
       Kyrian: Pelagos > Forgelite ~= Kleia
       Necrolord: Emeni > Bonesmith > Plague Deviser 

**Q:** What are the best Legendary Effectss and what gear slot should they be crafted on?
**A:** Single Target: Signet of Tormented Kings (Venthyr) > Enduring Blow (Non-venthyr) > Unhinged > Battlelord > Exploiter 
       AoE: Signet of Tormented Kings (All Covenants) > Seismic Reverberation > Unhinged > Rest
       Legendaries are typically crafted on gear with the most strength. This can vary from person to person. Due to Raid and M+ drops.
